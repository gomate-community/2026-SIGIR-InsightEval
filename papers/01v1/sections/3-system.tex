InsightEval provides an interactive web-based interface designed following the ``explainable and interactive'' principle. The interface employs a Master-Detail layout with three primary components, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:interface}.

\heading{Augmented Document Reader} (Left Panel, 55\%) The reader displays the paper content with color-coded sentence highlighting. Opinion sentences are highlighted using a purple gradient scale, where lighter purple indicates lower insightfulness and deeper purple indicates higher insightfulness. Users can click any highlighted sentence to inspect its detailed analysis.

\heading{Insight Analysis Panel} (Right Panel, 45\%) Upon selecting an opinion sentence, this panel reveals three key components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Alignment View}: Side-by-side comparison of the author's claim (left box) and retrieved evidence from cited references (right box).
    \item \textbf{Radar Chart}: A three-axis visualization displaying depth, breadth, and height scores.
    \item \textbf{AI Rationale}: The LLM's chain-of-thought explanation for the assigned scores, presented in a chat-bubble format.
\end{itemize}

\heading{Global Dashboard} (Bottom Panel) The sticky footer provides paper-level summary statistics including overall insight score, score distribution histogram, and AI-generated executive summary.

\heading{Workflow} Users interact with the studio through a simple workflow: (1) upload a PDF paper; (2) wait for processing (progress displayed in real-time); (3) explore results by clicking highlighted sentences; (4) export the insight report.
